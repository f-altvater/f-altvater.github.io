I started to build this site to apply and expand my HTML and CSS skillset.
On the way I also created some Scripts for some features for the site to make them a bit more interactive.

Since I plan to set it up as a real website for the animal welfare association this is not just a playground to fiddle but to also learn how to build a real
website that people can actually properly use on all devices with no drawbacks and some styling.
